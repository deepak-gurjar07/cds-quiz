      "answer": "USA",
      "explanation": "On December 24, 2024, President Joe Biden signed a bill officially designating the bald eagle as the national bird of the United States. Although the bald eagle had long been a symbol of American values—featured on the Great Seal, currency and various federal emblems—it had never been formally recognised as the national bird until this legislation was enacted. This move rectified a historical oversight, ensuring that the bald eagle holds its rightful place among the nation’s official symbols."
