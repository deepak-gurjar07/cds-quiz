Aditya-L1: Launched India's first dedicated solar observatory mission in September 2023.<br>ISRO routinely uses liquid-fueled rocket stages (like PSLV's PS2/PS4, GSLV's L40/Cryo stages), so 'Liquid fuel powered rockets' isn't a specific major mission *of 2023* itself. Solar-powered rockets are not a current operational technology for ISRO's primary launch vehicles."
