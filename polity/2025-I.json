      "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
      "explanation": "Statement 1: Incorrect. The 86th Constitutional Amendment Act (2002) did not add the Right to Education to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP). Instead, it added Article 21A in the Fundamental Rights section, making free and compulsory education for children aged 6–14 a Fundamental Right. <br>Statement 2: Incorrect. Right to Education is indeed a Fundamental Right (Article 21A) and is also supported under DPSP (Article 45). But Right to Work is only a Directive Principle (Article 41) and not a Fundamental Right. Therefore, the claim that both are Fundamental Rights and DPSPs is incorrect."
