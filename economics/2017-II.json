      "answer": "States were not willing to agree with the Union for introduction of GST without amendment in the Constitution.",
      "explanation": "The constitutional bill was presented by Union Finance Minister on 19th November 2014 to facilitate easy implementation of GST Law. The idea about GST was first time initiated by former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram. Under UPA Regime by introducing 115th Constitutional Amendment Bill 2011. But he failed to make consensus between Centre and State. Since its first day, the BJP led NDA government trying to push the biggest tax reform since 1947. In the Union budget also Union Finance Minister repeated the importance of GST. The States do not have the powers to levy a tax on supply of services while the Centre does not have power to levy tax on the sale of goods. Thus, the Constitution does not vest express power either in the Central or State Government to levy a tax on the ‘supply of goods and services’. Moreover, the Constitution also does not empower the States to impose tax on imports. Therefore, it is essential to have Constitutional Amendments for empowering the Centre to levy tax on sale of goods and States for levy of service tax and tax on imports and other consequential issues. As part of the exercise on Constitutional Amendment, there would be a special attention to the formulation of a mechanism for upholding the need for a harmonious structure for GST along with the concern for the powers of the Centre and the States in a federal structure. Thus the Constitution of India has been amended by the Constitution (one hundred and first amendment) Act, 2016 recently for this purpose. Article 246Aof the Constitution empowers the Centre and the States to levy and collect the GST."
