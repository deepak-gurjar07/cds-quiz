      "answer": "In England machines could be operated by wind or water power due to favourable climate condition",
      "explanation": "On the natural side England has in abundance three important commodities - water, iron and coal. Water in Britain's numerous hilly districts provides the power to drive mills in the early stages of industrialization; the rivers, amplified from 1761 by a developing network of canals, facilitate inland transport in an age where roads are only rough tracks; and the sea, never far from any part of Britain, makes transport of heavy goods easy between coastal cities."

      "answer": "Both 1 and 2",
      "explanation": "The decision to partially decontrol the sugar sector was taken by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA). This gives millers the freedom to sell in the open market and remove their obligation to supply the sweetener at subsidised rates to ration shops. The Rangarajan Committee has recommended total decontrol of the sugar industry by doing away with the levy sugar obligation, release mechanism and freeing of export-import."

      ],
      "answer": "reduce the burden of subsidies given to the oil companies",
      "explanation": "The sharp decline in crude oil price helped the government to deregulate the price of diesel and thus reduce a huge burden of subsidy on the exchequer. India if not a producing giant, is certainly a refining hub where it refines and markets around 220 metric million tonnes of petroleum products. Out of this around 160 mmt is used for domestic consumption while the rest is used for exports. Therefore, the drop in price of oil will be a blessing for the Indian refiners and the oil marketing companies."

Final consumption grew at an average of over 8% annually between 2009-10 and 2011-12. The result was strong inflation and a powerful monetary response that also slowed consumption demand.<br>2.
