      "answer": "Only 1",
      "explanation": "Typically, higher inflation is caused by strong economic growth.

If demand is rising faster than supply, then this suggests that economic growth is higher than the long run sustainable rate of growth.<br>Note: A sustained rise in prices is known as inflation. A large rise in prices is often caused by economic growth."
