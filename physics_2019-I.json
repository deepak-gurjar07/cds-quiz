    "question": "Two identical solid pieces, one of gold and other of silver, when immersed completely in water exhibit equal weights. When weighed in air (given that, density of gold is greater than that of silver),",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "the gold piece will weigh more",
      "the silver piece will weigh more",
      "Both silver and gold pieces weigh equal",
      "weighing will depend on their masses"
    ],
    "answer": "Both silver and gold pieces weigh equal",
    "explanation": "Since, gold is more denser than silver. But it is given that both pieces have identical and equal weight in water, it means both have equal volume and mass. (May be gold piece hollow inside.) (As we know, force of gravity is determined by mass and buoyant force is determined by volume) So, both silver and gold pieces weight equal in air."

    "question": "If the wavelengths corresponding to ultraviolet, visible and infrared radiations are given as $\\lambda_{ultraviolet}$, $\\lambda_{visible}$ and $\\lambda_{infrared}$ respectively, then which one of the following gives the correct relationship among these wavelengths?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [

      "$\\lambda_{ultraviolet} < \\lambda_{visible} < \\lambda_{infrared}$"
    ],
    "answer": "$\\lambda_{ultraviolet} < \\lambda_{visible} < \\lambda_{infrared}$",
    "explanation": "As we know that, infrared light has a lower frequency than visible light and visible light has a lower frequency than ultraviolet light. i.e. $\\nu_{ultraviolet} > \\nu_{visible} > \\nu_{infrared}$. Since, wavelength of a light is inversely proportional to its frequency, therefore $\\lambda_{ultraviolet} < \\lambda_{visible} < \\lambda_{infrared}$"

    "question": "An electron and a proton starting from rest get accelerated through potential difference of $100 \\text{ kV}$. The final speeds of the electron and the proton are $v_e$ and $v_p$, respectively. Which one of the following relation is correct?",
    "image": "",

      "$v_e > v_p$",
      "$v_e < v_p$",
      "$v_e = v_p$",
      "Cannot be determined"
    ],
    "answer": "$v_e > v_p$",
    "explanation": "As we know that, $\\text{KE} = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = qV$. For proton and electron, the relation of charge and mass are $q_p = -q_e$ and $m_p = m_e \\cdot 1840$. $v \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{2 q V}{m}} \\Rightarrow v \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}$. Here, we can see that mass of proton is very high than mass of electron, so $v_e > v_p$."

    "answer": "|$\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B}$| < |$\\mathbf{A}$| + |$\\mathbf{B}$|",
    "explanation": "Since, any one side of a triangle is less than the sum of the other two sides individually, so for any two vectors $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$, |$\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B}$| $\\leq$ |$\\mathbf{A}$| + |$\\mathbf{B}$|.

    "explanation": "The particle is moving with uniform acceleration along a straight line from rest. Displacement during $n^{\\text{th}}$ second, $s_n = u + \\frac{a}{2}(2n-1)$. Displacement during $6^{\\text{th}}$ second: $s_{6^{\\text{th}}} = u + \\frac{a}{2}(2 \\cdot 6 - 1)$. Given, $u = 0$. So, $s_{6^{\\text{th}}} = \\frac{a}{2}(11)$. In $5^{\\text{th}}$ second: $s_{5^{\\text{th}}} = \\frac{a}{2}(2 \\cdot 5 - 1) = \\frac{a}{2}(9)$. Percentage increase in displacement $= \\frac{s_{6^{\\text{th}}} - s_{5^{\\text{th}}}}{s_{5^{\\text{th}}}} \\times 100 = \\frac{\\frac{11a}{2} - \\frac{9a}{2}}{\\frac{9a}{2}} \\times 100 = \\frac{\\frac{2a}{2}}{\\frac{9a}{2}} \\times 100 = \\frac{2}{9} \\times 100 = 22.22\\% \\approx 22\\%$.
