      ],
      "answer": "Preventing unauthorised access to computer via the internet",
      "explanation": "A firewall is a security system designed to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Its primary purpose is to prevent unauthorised access to or from a private network, ensuring that only authorised users or applications can access the system over the internet. Firewalls help protect computers and networks from potential threats such as hacking attempts, malicious software and unauthorised data access."

        "Spreadsheet",
        "Auto CAD",
        "MS Power Point",
        "Linker"
      ],
      "answer": "Linker",
      "explanation": "A linker is not an application software; it is a system software. A linker is responsible for combining various pieces of code and data into a single executable program. It helps in the creation of programs by linking object files generated by a compiler. On the other hand, Spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel), AutoCAD and MS PowerPoint are all examples of application software, which are designed to perform specific tasks for users, such as data organisation, drawing and creating presentations."

      "answer": "Trojan Horse",
      "explanation": "A Trojan Horse is a type of malicious software (malware) that misleads users of its true intent. It often appears to be legitimate software or files but can cause harm to the system by giving unauthorised access to attackers, stealing data or executing harmful actions on the system. In contrast: Hacking is an activity... Password Cracking is the process... Firewall is a security measure..."

      "explanation": "Multimedia refers to the integration of various forms of media, such as text, graphics, video, audio and images, into a single interactive presentation. It is used in various applications like websites, presentations, educational software and entertainment. It allows users to engage with content in a dynamic and interactive way. In contrast: JPEG and PNG are image file formats."

        "Replicates human decision making",
        "Stores relevant information",
        "Stores similar kind of data for a specific purpose",
        "Allows user to interact with media"
      ],
      "answer": "Replicates human decision making",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is Replicates human decision making. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is designed to mimic or replicate human decision-making processes, allowing machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, reasoning and decision-making. AI can process data, recognise patterns and make decisions without human intervention."
