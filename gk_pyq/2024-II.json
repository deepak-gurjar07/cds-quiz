      "answer": "Near-sightedness",
      "explanation": "Myopia is a vision condition in which close objects appear clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. This occurs when the eyeball is too long or the cornea is too curved, causing light to focus in front of the retina.<br>Far-sightedness (Hyperopia) is the opposite. Cataract is clouding of the eye’s lens. Presbyopia is age-related difficulty in seeing nearby objects."

      "explanation": "Glass is an amorphous solid, meaning its atoms lack a long-range ordered structure like crystals. It's often called a supercooled liquid because its structure resembles a liquid frozen in place. Cooling molten glass typically prevents crystallization. Sodium silicate is water glass. Adding metal oxides creates colored glass. Therefore, the statement about crystallinity developing on cooling is incorrect for typical glass formation."

Sound travels faster in denser liquids and generally faster in liquids than gases. Among the given options, sea water is slightly denser and less compressible than distilled or drinking water due to dissolved salts, leading to a higher speed of sound.
