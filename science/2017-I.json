      "answer": "the doped silicon piece will become p~type",
      "explanation": "Aluminium is a p-type dopant, which means that when a semiconductor (silicon in this case) is doped with aluminium, it creates a hole (positively charged carrier) by accepting an electron from the silicon atom. Electrical conductivity of semiconductors increase and resistivity remains same."
