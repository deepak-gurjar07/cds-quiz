      "options": [
        "Ice melts more easily under black wrap",
        "Ice melts more easily under white wrap",
        "No ice melts at all under the black wrap",
        "No ice melts at all under the white wrap"
      ],
      "answer": "Ice melts more easily under black wrap",
      "explanation": "Ice under black wrap will melt easily because dark colour (black) absorbs the most of light energy falling on it."

      ],
      "answer": "help keeping inside cooler in summer and warmer in winter",
      "explanation": "The hollow bricks provide thermal insulations; the air in hollow bricks, does not allow outside heat or cold in the house to go out or come in the house. So, it keeps house cool in summer and warm in winter."

      "answer": "Boyle's law",
      "explanation": "As scuba driver ascends towards the water surface, water pressure decreases, so according to Boyle's law air in his lungs expands to occupy a greater volume. Which increase the chances of bursting the lungs."

      "answer": "rise a little higher",
      "explanation": "When a body is immersed in a fluid, the fluid exerts an upward force on it, called buoyant force. Here buoyant force µ density of fluid. As the density of sea water is higher than that of the fresh water. So extra buoyant force and ship will rise a little higher."
