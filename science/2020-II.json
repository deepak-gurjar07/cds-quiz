      "explanation": "Kinetic Energy (KE) is related to momentum (p) by the formula KE = p² / (2m). Since KE is proportional to the square of momentum (p²), if the momentum (p) is doubled (2p), the new KE will be (2p)² / (2m) = 4p² / (2m), which is 4 times the original kinetic energy."

      "explanation": "According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, the force (F) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between the objects (F ∝ 1/r²). If the distance is doubled (increased by 2 times), the force will decrease by a factor of 2², which is 4 times."

      "answer": "Thunderstorm",
      "explanation": "During a thunderstorm, we see the flash of lightning (light) almost instantly, but we hear the clap of thunder (sound) several seconds later. This delay occurs because light travels much faster (approx. 3x10⁸ m/s) than sound (approx. 343 m/s in air)."

      "answer": "Lens with power +2.5 D",
      "explanation": "The power of a lens (measured in Diopters, D) is a direct measure of its ability to bend light. A higher power (in absolute magnitude) corresponds to a shorter focal length and a greater bending angle. Comparing the absolute values (2.0, 2.5, 1.5, 2.0), the lens with power +2.5 D has the largest magnitude and will bend light the most."

      "explanation": "Using the lens formula 1/f = 1/v - 1/u.<br>Given: f = +25 cm (converging lens), u = -40 cm (object distance).<br>1/v = 1/f + 1/u = 1/25 + 1/(-40) = 1/25 - 1/40 = (8 - 5) / 200 = 3/200.<br>So, v = +200/3 cm (approx +66.7 cm).<br>Since 'v' is positive, the image is real and therefore inverted.<br>Magnification m = v/u = (+66.7) / (-40) = -1.67.

      ],
      "answer": "0°",
      "explanation": "An angle of incidence of 0° means the light ray is striking the surface along the normal (perpendicular to the surface). According to Snell's Law ($n_1 \sin(i) = n_2 \sin(r)$), if $i = 0°$, then $\sin(i) = 0$. This forces $\sin(r)$ to also be 0, meaning the angle of refraction $r = 0°$. The ray passes straight through without bending."

      ],
      "answer": "A point source and an opaque screen",
      "explanation": "To form a shadow, the screen must be opaque (to stop light). To make the shadow sharp (a clear umbra with minimal penumbra or blurriness), the light source must be as small as possible, ideally a point source. An extended source creates a fuzzy shadow."
