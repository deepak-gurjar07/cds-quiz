      "explanation": "The power of a lens (measured in Diopters, D) is a direct measure of its ability to bend light. A higher power (in absolute magnitude) corresponds to a shorter focal length and a greater bending angle. Comparing the absolute values (2.0, 2.5, 1.5, 2.0), the lens with power +2.5 D has the largest magnitude and will bend light the most."

      "answer": "0°",
      "explanation": "An angle of incidence of 0° means the light ray is striking the surface along the normal (perpendicular to the surface). According to Snell's Law (n₁sin(i) = n₂sin(r)), if i = 0°, then sin(i) = 0. This forces sin(r) to also be 0, meaning the angle of refraction r = 0°. The ray passes straight through without bending."

      "answer": "A point source and an opaque screen",
      "explanation": "To form a shadow, the screen must be opaque (to stop light). To make the shadow sharp (a clear umbra with minimal penumbra or blurriness), the light source must be as small as possible, ideally a point source. An extended source creates a fuzzy shadow."
