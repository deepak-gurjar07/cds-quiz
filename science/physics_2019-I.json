    "question": "Two identical solid pieces, one of gold and other of silver, when immersed completely in water exhibit equal weights. When weighed in air (given that, density of gold is greater than that of silver),",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "the gold piece will weigh more",
      "the silver piece will weigh more",
      "Both silver and gold pieces weigh equal",
      "weighing will depend on their masses"
    ],
    "answer": "Both silver and gold pieces weigh equal",
    "explanation": "Since, gold is more denser than silver. But it is given that both pieces have identical and equal weight in water, it means both have equal volume and mass. (May be gold piece hollow inside.) (As we know, force of gravity is determined by mass and buoyant force is determined by volume) So, both silver and gold pieces weight equal in air."

    "question": "If the wavelengths corresponding to ultraviolet, visible and infrared radiations are given as λ_ultraviolet, λ_visible and λ_infrared respectively, then which one of the following gives the correct relationship among these wavelengths?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "λ_ultraviolet < λ_infrared < λ_visible",
      "λ_ultraviolet > λ_visible > λ_infrared",
      "λ_ultraviolet > λ_infrared > λ_visible",
      "λ_ultraviolet < λ_visible < λ_infrared"
    ],
    "answer": "λ_ultraviolet < λ_visible < λ_infrared",
    "explanation": "As we know that, infrared light has a lower frequency than visible light and visible light has a lower frequency than ultraviolet light. i.e. ν_ultraviolet > ν_visible > ν_infrared. Since, wavelength of a light is inversely proportional to its frequency, therefore λ_ultraviolet < λ_visible < λ_infrared"

    "question": "An electron and a proton starting from rest get accelerated through potential difference of 100 kV. The final speeds of the electron and the proton are vₑ and vₚ, respectively. Which one of the following relation is correct?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "vₑ > vₚ",
      "vₑ < vₚ",
      "vₑ = vₚ",
      "Cannot be determined"
    ],
    "answer": "vₑ > vₚ",
    "explanation": "As we know that, KE = ½ mv² = qV. For proton and electron, the relation of charge and mass are qₚ = -qₑ and mₚ = mₑ ⋅ 1840. v ∝ √(2qV/m) ⇒ v ∝ 1/√m. Here, we can see that mass of proton is very high than mass of electron, so vₑ > vₚ."

      "|A| + |B| = |A - B|"
    ],
    "answer": "|A| + |B| > |A + B|",
    "explanation": "Since, any one side of a triangle is less than the sum of the other two sides individually, so for any two vectors A and B, |A + B| ≤ |A| + |B|. If θ ≠ 0°, then |A + B| < |A| + |B|."
