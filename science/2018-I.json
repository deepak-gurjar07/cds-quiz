      "explanation": "The principle of operation of an atomic clock is based on atomic physics. It uses the microwave signal that electrons in atoms emit when they change energy levels. An atomic clock uses an electron transition frequency in the microwave, optical, or ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum of atoms as a frequency standard for its timekeeping element. Caesium-based atomic clocks use the electromagnetic transitions of caesium-133 atoms as a reference point. Caesium is a chemical element with symbol Cs and atomic number 55. It is a soft, silvery-gold alkali metal."

Wire 1 has resistance R. Wire 2 is the same length, but twice the radius, so 4 times the cross sectional area. So wire 2 has a resistance of R/4.

Therefore, light other than red is mostly scattered away. Most of the red light, which is the least scattered, enters our eyes. Hence, the sun and the sky appear red."

Toxic substances are lipophilic or fat-loving, the reason why these substances are deposited and concentrated in the fat tissues of the organisms. The affected organism has a higher concentration of the substance than the concentration in the organism's surrounding environment. The toxic substances are very slowly metabolized or excreted so if the organism keeps on consuming prey or food contaminated with toxic substances, the concentration of the substance will further increase in its body, hence, bioaccumulation results. When a certain threshold level is reached, measured in parts per million (ppm), symptoms due to the type of toxin are manifested."
