      "answer": "Caesium",
      "explanation": "The principle of operation of an atomic clock is based on atomic physics. It uses the microwave signal that electrons in atoms emit when they change energy levels. An atomic clock uses an electron transition frequency in the microwave, optical, or ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum of atoms as a frequency standard for its timekeeping element. Caesium-based atomic clocks use the electromagnetic transitions of caesium-133 atoms as a reference point. Caesium is a chemical element with symbol Cs and atomic number 55. It is a soft, silvery-gold alkali metal."

      "answer": "To increase the life of the bulb",
      "explanation": "Argon gas is used in fluorescent and incandescent light bulbs to stop the oxygen in the light bulbs from corroding the hot tungsten filament. The use of argon in light bulbs prevents the evaporation of the tungsten filaments, which results in increased light bulb life."

      "explanation": "Use the equation R = rho * l / A, Where R = resistance; l = length; A = cross sectional area, rho = resistivity. Assume the wires are circular cross section. Wire 1 has resistance R. Wire 2 is the same length, but twice the radius, so 4 times the cross sectional area. So wire 2 has a resistance of R/4. So total resistance of 2 in series = R + R/4 = 5/4 * R"

      "explanation": "According to Rayleigh's law, the intensity of scattered light varies inversely as the fourth power of its wavelength. Sunlight consists of seven colours. Of these, red has the maximum wavelength. During sunrise and sunset, the rays have to travel a larger part of the atmosphere because they are very close to the horizon. Therefore, light other than red is mostly scattered away. Most of the red light, which is the least scattered, enters our eyes. Hence, the sun and the sky appear red."
