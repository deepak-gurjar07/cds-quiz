      "answer": "C-12 and C-14",
      "explanation": "The method of determining the age of an object containing organic material by using the properties of radioactive isotope of carbon is known as Radiocarbon dating or carbon dating. Radioactive isotopes have unstable nuclei that break down i.e., decay and form other elements. C-12 and C-14 are the two isotopes of carbon which is used to determine the age of fossil."
