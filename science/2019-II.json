      "explanation": "Magnification is the process of enlarging the apparent size, not physical size, of something. This enlargement is quantified by a calculated number also called “magnification”. When this number is less than one, it refers to a reduction in size, sometimes called minification or de-magnification."

      "answer": "good absorbers of water",
      "explanation": "Cotton readily absorbs water. This is because the fibers of the cotton have a lot of space between them. One reason cellulose makes cotton absorbent is that it contains a negative charge, which helps attract “dipolar” water molecules and absorb them. Another reason is cotton’s “hydrophilic properties.”"

      "explanation": "A matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. Pen, paper, clips, sand, air, ice, etc. are different forms of matter. Every matter is made up of tiny particles. These particles are so tiny that they can’t be seen with naked eyes. Every substance is made up of particles. These particles exhibit some characteristics. They can influence the state and properties (physical and chemical) of a substance. The five characteristics shown by particles of matter are as follows. 1. All matter is made of particles 2. Particles have space between them 3. Particles are always moving 4. Particles move faster and get farther apart when heated 5. Particles are attracted to each other"

      "explanation": "The distance-time graph determines the change in the position of the object. The speed of the object as well can be determined using the line graph. Here the time lies on the x-axis while the distance on the y-axis. The line graph of uniform motion is always a straight line or Horizontal."

      "answer": "a non-zero but not a constant",
      "explanation": "Uniform circular motion is accelerated because the velocity changes due to continuous change in the direction of motion. So even when the body moves to a constant speed its velocity is not constant. Therefore circular motion is an acceleration motion even when the speed remains constant."

Increasing the speed of the relative motion between the coil and the magnet – If the same coil of wire passed through the same magnetic field but its speed or velocity is increased, the wire will cut the lines of flux at a faster rate so more induced emf would be produced."
