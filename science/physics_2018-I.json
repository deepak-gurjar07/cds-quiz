      "Principle of thermal equilibrium",
      "Principle of colours",
      "Principle of calorimetry",
      "Principle of vaporisation"
    ],
    "answer": "Principle of calorimetry",
    "explanation": "‘Heat Lost = Heat gained’ represents the principle of calorimetry. According to this principle, if two substances of different temperatures are brought in contact with each other, then heat flows from the substance at a higher temperature to the substance at a lower temperature, until their temperatures become equal (equilibrium state). This principle is based on the law of conservation of energy."

    "question": "Two metallic wires made from copper have the same length, but the radius of wire 1 is half that of wire 2. The resistance of wire 1 is R. If both the wires are joined together in series, what is the total resistance?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "2R",
      "R/2",
      "5R/4",
      "3R/4"
    ],
    "answer": "5R/4",
    "explanation": "Resistance is given by R = ρl/A, and Area A = πr². So, R is proportional to 1/r². Let the radius of wire 1 be r, so its resistance R₁ = R. The radius of wire 2 is 2r. Its resistance R₂ will be R₁ * (r/2r)² = R/4. When joined in series, the total resistance is Req = R₁ + R₂ = R + R/4 = 5R/4."

      "reflection of light",
      "refraction of light",
      "dispersion of light",
      "scattering of light"
    ],
    "answer": "scattering of light",
    "explanation": "When the sun is near the horizon, sunlight passes through thicker layers of air and covers a larger distance in the atmosphere. During this journey, most of the blue light and shorter wavelengths are scattered away by the air molecules. The light that reaches our eyes is therefore mostly of longer wavelengths, like red and orange, making the sun appear reddish."

    "question": "A wire of copper having length l and area of cross-section A is taken and a current I is flown through it. The power dissipated in the wire is P. If we take an aluminium wire having the same dimensions and pass the same current through it, the power dissipated will be:",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "P",
      "< P",
      "> P",
      "2P"
    ],
    "answer": "> P",
    "explanation": "Power dissipated is given by P = I²R. Resistance R = ρl/A, where ρ is resistivity. So, P = I²(ρl/A). Since I, l, and A are the same for both wires, power (P) is directly proportional to resistivity (ρ). The resistivity of aluminium (ρ_Al) is greater than the resistivity of copper (ρ_Cu). Therefore, the power dissipated in the aluminium wire will be greater than in the copper wire."

    "answer": "Pascal’s law",
    "explanation": "The expression p = p₀ + ρgh relates the absolute pressure (p) at a certain depth to the atmospheric pressure (p₀) and the gauge pressure (ρgh). This formula directly describes how pressure in a fluid increases with depth, which is a fundamental concept explained by Pascal's law concerning pressure in a fluid at rest."

    ],
    "answer": "To increase the life of the bulb",
    "explanation": "Argon is an inert (unreactive) gas. It is used in incandescent bulbs to create an inert atmosphere that prevents the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing and evaporating too quickly. This significantly slows down the degradation of the filament and increases the operational life of the bulb."

    ],
    "answer": "T = t_C + 273.15",
    "explanation": "To convert a temperature from Celsius to Kelvin, you add 273.15. The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale where 0 K is absolute zero, which corresponds to -273.15°C."

    "answer": "wooden hollow pipe placed in vacuum",
    "explanation": "Sound waves are mechanical waves, which means they require a medium (like a solid, liquid, or gas) to propagate by causing vibrations in particles. A vacuum is a space devoid of matter, so there are no particles to vibrate. Therefore, sound cannot travel through a vacuum."

    "answer": "10⁻⁷ cm",
    "explanation": "A nanometre (nm) is 10⁻⁹ metres. Since 1 metre = 100 centimetres (10² cm), then 1 nm = 10⁻⁹ m * (10² cm / 1 m) = 10⁻⁷ cm."

    "explanation": "1. Correct: For a body to be in rotational equilibrium, the net torque (moment) acting on it must be zero.\n2. Incorrect: The momentum of a body (or system) is conserved only if there are no external forces acting on it.\n3. Incorrect: The kinetic energy of an object is conserved only in perfectly elastic collisions; it is often converted to other forms of energy like heat or sound."

If the current exceeds this safe value, the excessive heat generated (proportional to the square of the current) melts the fuse wire, breaking the circuit."
