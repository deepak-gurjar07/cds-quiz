        "Sounds wave in gases are longitudinal in nature",
        "Sounds wave having frequency below 20 Hz are known as ultrasonic waves",
        "Sounds waves having higher amplitudes are louder",
        "Sound waves with high audible frequencies are sharp"

      "answer": "Sounds wave having frequency below 20 Hz are known as ultrasonic waves",
      "explanation": "The sound waves having frequency below 20 Hz are inaudible. Ultrasonic waves are those waves which have the frequency of above 20,000 Hz."
