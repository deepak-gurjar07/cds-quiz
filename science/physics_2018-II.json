    "answer": "22%",
    "explanation": "The particle is moving with **uniform acceleration (a)** along a straight line **from rest (u=0)**.\n\nThe displacement during the n-th second is given by the formula: Sₙ = u + (a/2)(2n-1).\n\n**1. Displacement during 6th second (S₆):**\nS₆ = 0 + (a/2)(2⋅6 - 1) = 11a/2\n\n**2. Displacement during 5th second (S₅):**\nS₅ = 0 + (a/2)(2⋅5 - 1) = 9a/2\n\n**3. Percentage Increase:**\nPercentage increase = ((S₆ - S₅) / S₅) × 100\n= ((11a/2 - 9a/2) / (9a/2)) × 100\n= ((2a/2) / (9a/2)) × 100 = (2/9) × 100 ≈ **22.22%**."

    "answer": "on the xy-plane and along the x-direction",
    "explanation": "We find velocity (v) and acceleration (a) by differentiation with respect to time (t): v = dr/dt and a = dv/dt.\n\n**1. Instantaneous Velocity (v):**\nv = d/dt (2ti + 3tj + 4t²k) = 2i + 3j + 8tk\nThis vector has components in the i, j, and k directions, so it generally lies in 3D space.\n\n**2. Instantaneous Acceleration (a):**\na = d/dt (2i + 3j + 8tk) = 0i + 0j + 8k\nThis vector only has a k component, so it lies along the **z-direction**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The acceleration is along the z-direction. None of the options correctly describe the velocity, but option (a) has the correct acceleration. (The provided answer 'd' is inconsistent with the question's formula)."

    "question": "Two persons are holding a rope of negligible mass horizontally. A 20 kg mass is attached to the rope at the mid-point, and the rope deviates from the horizontal. The tension required to completely straighten the rope is (g = 10 m/s²):",

    "answer": "infinitely large",
    "explanation": "1.  **Weight (Force):** The weight of the mass pulling down is W = m⋅g = 20 kg ⋅ 10 m/s² = 200 N.\n\n2.  **Tension Analysis:** For the rope to be in equilibrium, the upward vertical component of tension must balance the weight. If T is the tension in each half of the rope and θ is the angle it makes with the horizontal, the upward force is 2T⋅sin(θ).\n    2T⋅sin(θ) = W = 200 N\n\n3.  **Condition for Straightening:** To 'completely straighten' the rope (make it perfectly horizontal), the angle θ must approach **0°**.\n\n4.  **Result:** As θ → 0°, sin(θ) → 0. To maintain the balance (2T⋅0 = 200), the tension T must approach **infinity** (T = 200 / 0)."

This happens when the object is placed at a distance of **twice the focal length** (u = 2f) from the lens.\n3.  At this position, the image is also formed at a distance of **twice the focal length** (v = 2f).\n\nTherefore, the minimum separation is: \nS_min = |u| + v = 2f + 2f = **4f** (four times the focal length)."
