      "answer": "The athlete's angular momentum",
      "explanation": "When a athlete jumps from the spring board, he curls his body by rolling his arms and legs in. By doing so, he decreases moment of inertia of his body and hence angular speed increases to conserve the angular momentum, as I1 w1 = I2 w2 = constant."
