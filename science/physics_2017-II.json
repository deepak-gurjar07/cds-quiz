    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "The kinetic energy of both the particles will be different.",
      "The speed of the electron will be higher than that of the proton.",
      "The speed of the proton will be higher than that of the electron.",
      "The speed of the electron and the proton will be equal."
    ],
    "answer": "The speed of the electron will be higher than that of the proton.",
    "explanation": "The kinetic energy (K) gained is K = qV. Since both particles have the same charge magnitude (e) and accelerate through the same potential (V), their kinetic energies will be equal. From K = ½mv², we can say ½mₑvₑ² = ½mₚvₚ². This rearranges to (vₑ/vₚ)² = mₚ/mₑ. Because the mass of a proton (mₚ) is much greater than the mass of an electron (mₑ), the electron must have a much higher speed (vₑ) to have the same kinetic energy."

    "question": "Two wires are made having same length l and area of cross-section A. Wire 1 is made of copper and wire 2 is made of aluminium. It is given that the electrical conductivity of copper is more than that of aluminium. In this context, which one of the following statements is correct?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "The resistance of wire 1 will be higher than that of wire 2.",
      "The resistance of wire 2 will be higher than that of wire 1.",
      "The resistance of both the wires will be the same.",
      "If same current is flown through both the wires, the power dissipated in both the wires will be the same."
    ],
    "answer": "The resistance of wire 2 will be higher than that of wire 1.",
    "explanation": "Resistance (R) is calculated as R = ρl/A, where ρ is resistivity. Resistivity is the inverse of conductivity (σ). Since copper has higher conductivity (σ_Cu > σ_Al), it has lower resistivity (ρ_Cu < ρ_Al). As both wires have the same length and area, the wire with the higher resistivity (aluminium, wire 2) will have the higher resistance."

By the law of reflection, the angle of reflection (r) is also 50°. <br><br> <img src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNVeHO6rfdC36z3Mj0b1v1Ewl6Brc8hrIRI4JbjoTaPDJ9qYmemk5Su9W0n_FV_V1UcCnpDGLvAxi4taMglpAoBCFf9cpMgu8FAwtbGRfFJ8BNJyH7I9E2xx2tUGMVgbJ48mcCi5fxYkQ_MJ8Y6QUBkvPKH4tXeRaVSqVU4kuWA9OyHA2xaPbUH6Uwy-W3/s1600/Screenshot%202025-10-16%20144048.png' alt='Diagram of light reflection' style='max-width:300px; display:block; margin:auto;'> <br>The angle of deviation (δ) is calculated as δ = 180° - (i + r) = 180° - (50° + 50°) = **80°**."

      "The photon energy of ultraviolet is less than that of visible light."
    ],
    "answer": "The photon energy of ultraviolet is less than that of visible light.",
    "explanation": "The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength (E ∝ 1/λ). The order of wavelengths is λ_infrared > λ_visible > λ_ultraviolet. Therefore, the order of energy is E_infrared < E_visible < E_ultraviolet. The statement that the photon energy of ultraviolet is less than that of visible light is incorrect."

      "1, 2 and 3"
    ],
    "answer": "1 and 2",
    "explanation": "Transformers heat up primarily due to two types of energy loss: 1. Joule heating (or copper loss), where the current flowing through the resistance of the windings generates heat (P = I²R). 2. Hysteresis loss (or iron loss), where energy is lost as heat in the core during the continuous cycle of magnetization and demagnetization from the AC current. The cooling liquid is there to manage this heat, not to cause it."

      "By jumping",
      "By running",

    ],
    "answer": "By sneezing",
    "explanation": "To move on a frictionless surface, one must apply a force according to Newton's Third Law (action-reaction). Jumping, running, or rolling requires friction. Sneezing forcefully expels air mass in one direction (action), which creates an equal and opposite force on the person (reaction), pushing them in the opposite direction. This demonstrates the principle of conservation of momentum."

    "answer": "isoenthalpic process",
    "explanation": "The Joule-Thomson effect describes the temperature change of a gas when it is forced through a porous plug or valve while being thermally insulated. The defining thermodynamic characteristic of this process is that the enthalpy of the gas remains constant. Therefore, it is an isoenthalpic process."

    "answer": "piezoelectric material",
    "explanation": "Ultrasonic waves are generated using transducers that rely on the piezoelectric effect. Piezoelectric materials, like quartz crystals, change shape when a voltage is applied to them. By applying a high-frequency alternating voltage, the material vibrates rapidly, producing high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound)."

    "question": "A person throws an object on a horizontal frictionless plane surface. It is noticed that there are two forces acting on this object – (i) gravitational pull and (ii) normal reaction of the surface. Which one of the following can be said for the motion of the object?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "The object will move with acceleration.",
      "The object will move with deceleration.",
      "The object will move with constant speed but varying direction.",
      "The object will move with constant velocity."
    ],
    "answer": "The object will move with constant velocity.",
    "explanation": "The vertical forces (gravity down, normal force up) cancel each other out. Since the surface is frictionless, there are no horizontal forces acting on the object after it is thrown. According to Newton's First Law, with a net force of zero, the object will continue to move with the constant velocity it had at the moment it was released."

In a nuclear reactor, the reaction is controlled, while in nuclear bombs, the reaction is uncontrolled.\n3.

    ],
    "answer": "2 and 3",
    "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect; both use a chain reaction. Statement 2 is correct; reactors control the reaction rate with control rods, while bombs have an uncontrolled, exponential reaction. Statement 3 is correct; a reactor operates at a 'critical' state where the chain reaction is self-sustaining at a steady rate. A bomb is 'supercritical', meaning the reaction rate accelerates explosively."
