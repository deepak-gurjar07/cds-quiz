      "answer": "cropping intensity",
      "explanation": "Higher cropping intensity means that a larger portion of the net area is being cropped more than once during an agricultural year. Crop rotation is growing different crops in succession on a particular land. Genetic and phenotypic diversity of plants used in agriculture is called cropping diversity and ratio of agricultural outputs to agricultural inputs is crop productivity."
