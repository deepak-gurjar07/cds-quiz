        "2, 1, 3, 4"
      ],
      "answer": "2, 1, 3, 4",
      "explanation": "The correct sequence of the mountain ranges as one moves from North to South is: 2, 1, 3, 4.\nLet’s examine their relative positions from north to south:\nKunlun Range – Located farthest to the north, mostly in China, north of the Karakoram.\nKarakoram Range – Lies south of Kunlun, forming part of the boundary between India and China, and includes peaks like K2.\nLadakh Range – Lies south of Karakoram, in the northernmost part of India.\nZaskar Range – Lies south of Ladakh, part of the greater Himalayan region."

      "question": "Which of the following statements with reference to saline soil in India is/are correct?\n1. They are rich in nitrogen\n2. They occur in arid and semi-arid regions, and in waterlogged and swampy areas.\nSelect the answer using the code given below:",
      "image": "",

        "2 only",
        "Both 1 and 2",
        "Neither 1 nor 2"
      ],
      "answer": "2 only",
      "explanation": "Saline soils in India typically occur in arid and semi-arid regions as well as waterlogged and swampy areas due to the accumulation of soluble salts. These soils are not rich in nitrogen; in fact, they are generally poor in nitrogen and organic matter. The presence of excessive salts hampers nutrient uptake by plants, making them less fertile. Hence, while Statement 2 is correct, Statement 1 is incorrect."

      "answer": "Chenab",
      "explanation": "The Salal Power Project is situated on the Chenab River in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, India. It is one of the major hydroelectric projects in the region and plays an important role in generating electricity and supporting irrigation. The project harnesses the fast-flowing waters of the Chenab River, which originates in the Himalayas and flows through India and Pakistan."

        "Hunza",
        "Zaskar"
      ],
      "answer": "Gomal",
      "explanation": "The Gomal River does not originate in the Himalayas. Instead, it originates from the eastern slopes of the Katawaz Range in Afghanistan, which is part of the Sulaiman mountain system, not the Himalayas. In contrast, the Gilgit, Hunza and Zaskar rivers are Himalayan tributaries of the Indus. The Gomal flows through arid regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan before joining the Indus River, making it distinct in origin and terrain."

      ],
      "answer": "Odisha and Jharkhand",
      "explanation": "According to the Annual Report 2023–24 of the Ministry of Mines, Government of India, the major bauxite-producing states in India are Odisha and Jharkhand. Based on multiple sources, Odisha consistently ranks as the top bauxite producer in India, often accounting for over half of the total output. Jharkhand is also listed as a significant bauxite producer. While other states like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh also produce bauxite, they are not mentioned prominently in most reports. Therefore, “Odisha and Jharkhand” is the most accurate answer based on the query."

The term ‘Western Rivers’ means the Indus, the Jhelum and the Chenab taken together.\nSelect the answer using the code given below:",

        "Neither 1 nor 2"
      ],
      "answer": "Both 1 and 2",
      "explanation": "The Indus Waters Treaty, signed between India and Pakistan in 1960 and brokered by the World Bank, classifies the rivers of the Indus basin into two groups:\nEastern Rivers: These include the Sutlej, Beas and Ravi—allocated to India for exclusive use.\nWestern Rivers: These include the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab—primarily allocated to Pakistan, although India can use them for limited domestic, agricultural and hydroelectric purposes under specific conditions.\nSo, both statements are correct."
