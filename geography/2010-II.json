      "explanation": "Tropical easterly jet stream occurs near the tropopause over Southeast Asia, India and Africa during summer. This jet is closely connected to the Indian and African summer monsoons. The existence of this jet implies that there is a deep layer of warm air to the north of the jet and colder air to the south over the Indian Ocean. This warm air is of course associated with the maximum heating taking place over India in summer, while the colder air is over the ocean. The difference in heating and cooling and the ensuing pressure gradient is what drives this jet."

This motion causes the regions closer to the equator to bulge outwards resulting in the current shape of the Earth. Earth is not perfectly spherical. The pull of gravity on an object changes as the distance of the object from the centre of the earth changes. If the Earth were a perfect sphere, then objects would weigh exactly the same any place on Earth (as long as they were at the same elevation). In reality, the weight of an object varies as it changes its position on the Earth's surface. At the equator, where the Earth's diameter is greatest, objects weigh a little less. At the Poles, where the Earth's diameter is the least, objects weight a little more."
