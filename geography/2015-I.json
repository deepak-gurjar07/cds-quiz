      "explanation": "Tides are rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effect of the gravitational forces exerted by the moon and the sun and the rotation of the earth because the Earth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the sun. The tidal range is not constant but changes depending on where the sun and moon are."

      ],
      "answer": "Both the statements are individually true but Statement II is not the correct explanation of Statement I",
      "explanation": "The sidereal day is the time it takes for the Earth to complete one rotation about its axis with respect to the 'fixed' stars. By fixed, we mean that we treat the stars as if they were attached to an imaginary celestial sphere at a very large distance from the Earth. A measurement of the sidereal day is made by noting the time at which a particular star passes the celestial meridian (i.e. directly overhead) on two successive nights. On Earth, a sidereal day lasts for 23 hours 56 minutes 4.091 seconds, which is slightly shorter than the solar day measured from noon to noon. At the same time that the Earth spins on its axis, it also orbits or revolves around the Sun. This movement is called revolution."

      ],
      "answer": "1 and 2 only",
      "explanation": "The Earth completes one \"rotation\" every twenty four hours. A rotation is when the planet spins around once. The Earth rotates counter-clockwise; this is why the Sun \"rises\" in the east and \"sets\" in the west. Revolution is when one object completes a circular path around another object. The Earth takes 365.24 days to revolve around the Sun. This is why a year is 365 days long. During the year the Earth is angled differently towards the Sun. These changing angles provide us with different Sun intensities and therefore we get four different seasons."
