      "answer": "1, 2, 3 and 4",
      "explanation": "The stratosphere extends from the top of the troposphere to about 50 km (31 miles) above the ground. In this layer temperature increases with increase in altitude. Above the stratosphere is the mesosphere. It extends upward to a height of about 85 km (53 miles) above our planet. Most meteors burn up in the mesosphere. Unlike the stratosphere, temperatures once again grow colder as you rise up through the mesosphere. The coldest temperatures in Earth's atmosphere, about -90° C (-130° F), are found near the top of this layer. At the upper edge of the troposphere is a narrow transition zone known as the tropopause, which is an isothermal zone."
