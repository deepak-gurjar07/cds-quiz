      ],
      "answer": "2 only",
      "explanation": "Saline soils in India typically occur in arid and semi-arid regions as well as waterlogged and swampy areas due to the accumulation of soluble salts. These soils are not rich in nitrogen; in fact, they are generally poor in nitrogen and organic matter. The presence of excessive salts hampers nutrient uptake by plants, making them less fertile. Hence, while Statement 2 is correct, Statement 1 is incorrect."

Instead, it originates from the eastern slopes of the Katawaz Range in Afghanistan, which is part of the Sulaiman mountain system, not the Himalayas. In contrast, the Gilgit, Hunza and Zaskar rivers are Himalayan tributaries of the Indus. The Gomal flows through arid regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan before joining the Indus River, making it distinct in origin and terrain."
