      "answer": "Both the statements are individually true but Statement II is not the correct explanation of Statement I",
      "explanation": "A sinkhole is a hole in the ground that forms when water dissolves surface rock. Often, this surface rock is limestone, which is easily eroded, or worn away, by the movement of water. In a landscape where limestone sits underneath the soil, water from rainfallcollects in cracks in the stone. These cracks are called joints. Slowly, as the limestone dissolves and is carried away, the joints widen until the ground above them becomes unstable and collapses. The collapse often happens very suddenly and without very much warning. Water collects in these collapsed sections, forming sinkholes. Sinkholes also form when the roofs of caves collapse. Sinkholes are often funnel-shaped, with the wide end open at the surface and the narrow end at the bottom of the pool."

      ],
      "answer": "Expansion and compression of the air",
      "explanation": "Expansion and compression of the air causes adiabatic temperature changes in atmosphere. As air is heated it expands becoming less dense, and as a result, lighter. Because it is lighter, it rises upwards above the cooler air. As it does so, this air continues to expand. This is because there is less pressure higher in the atmosphere, allowing the air molecules to spread out more. In order to spread out, these molecules require energy. As they do so, they become less agitated and vibrate slower. As a result, the temperature of these air molecules drops, despite the fact that no heat has been removed from them. This process is referred to as adiabatic cooling. As the air cools down, it again begins to fall towards the surface of the Earth. As it sinks deeper into the atmosphere, the pressure from the weight of the air above it pushes air molecules closer together, causing them to become more agitated and heating them up again. As a result, their temperature rises, even though no heat has been added. This process is referred to as adiabatic warming."

      "explanation": "The collision-coalescence process is an important mechanism in forming raindrops in warmer clouds (those with tops warmer than –15°C = 5°F). In these warm clouds raindrops form exclusively by this process. Most tropical rain is formed in this way. The collision- coalescence process is of relatively little importance in middle and high latitudes where, even in the summer, most precipitation begins high in the clouds where temperatures are well below freezing and the dominant precipitation-producing mechanism is the so-called ice-crystal or Bergeron process. However falling raindrops in these clouds do grow by the collision-coalescence process."

      "explanation": "The Planetesimal hypothesis was proposed in 1905 by geologist Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin and astronomer Forest Ray Moulton to describe the formation of the solar system. Thermal contraction theory is given by Jeffery. The theory is based essentially on the history of the contraction of the earth. According to Jeffrey's the earth began to shrink because of contraction caused by gradual cooling of the earth due to loss of heat through radiation from the very beginning of its origin. Famous German geologist Kober has presented a detailed and systematic description of the surface features of the earth in his book 'Der Bau der Erde'. Kober's geosynclinal theory is based on the forces of contraction produced by the cooling of the earth. He believes in the contraction history of the earth. Daly postulated his theory of sliding continents in his book 'Our Mobile Earth' in the year 1926 to explain the origin and evolution of different relief features of the earth's surface."

      "answer": "A-2, B-4, C-1, D-3",
      "explanation": "Cirrus clouds form in very cold air at high altitudes. Made of ice crystals, they have a wispy or feathery appearance. Strong winds often blow streamers or \"tails\" off cirrus clouds. These features show the direction of the wind in the upper troposphere. Stratus nebulosus clouds appear as a featureless or nebulous veil or layer of stratus clouds with no distinctive features or structure. They are found at low altitudes, and is a good sign of atmospheric stability, which indicates continuous stable weather. Stratus nebulosus may produce light drizzle or flakes of snow. Nimbus are dark, low-level clouds accompanied by light to moderately falling precipitation. Low clouds are primarily composed of water droplets since their bases generally lie below 6,500 feet (2,000 meters). However, when temperatures are cold enough, these clouds may also contain ice particles and snow. Cumulus clouds are clouds which have flat bases and are often described as \"puffy\", \"cotton-like\" or \"fluffy\" in appearance. These clouds grow high up into the atmosphere rather than spreading across the sky. They span all levels of the troposphere and can even rise up into the stratosphere."

      "answer": "Himalayas",
      "explanation": "Extrusive igneous landforms are the result of magma coming from deep within the earth to the surface, where it cools as lava. This can happen explosively or slowly, depending on the chemical composition of the lava and whether there is an easy path for it to take to the surface. If there is not a pathway, pressure builds up over time (like a shaken soda) until the magma forcibly explodes outward. There are no extrusive volcano in Himalayas. Himalayas lies in highly earthquake prone areas as the mountains there are the result of tectonic collision of particular variant of its type. The Himalayas are a plate- to-plate collision tectonic boundary. In this case, the Indian Plate [of the Indian Subcontinent] is colliding head- on with the Eurasian Plate. Both plates are comprised of continental lithospheric crust, so there is no appreciable distinction in density. Both have a density of approximately 2.7 g/cm³. This as opposed to ocean crust with a mean density of 3.3 g/cm³. The plates try to compete in the plate-to-plate collision but the equal densities of the two plates cannot push one under the other very deep like that in a subduction zone. The result is large-scale thickening of the continental crust in the region at and surrounding the collision boundary. Other processes occurring in the Himalayas region associated with the orogeny are metamorphism, thrust [compression] faulting, and plateau uplift. The crust is too thick, and too \"squashed together\" to allow anything to squeeze up and break through to the surface as volcanic eruptions."
