      "answer": "the Antarctic caused mainly by CFC gases.",
      "explanation": "The 'ozone hole' refers to the significant seasonal thinning of the ozone layer in the stratosphere, which is most pronounced over Antarctica during its spring (August-October). This depletion is primarily caused by human-produced chemicals, especially chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which release chlorine and bromine atoms that catalytically destroy ozone molecules under specific polar stratospheric conditions."
