Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.<br>4. Ozone layer has no significance for life on the Earth.<br>Which of the statements given above is/are correct?",

      ],
      "answer": "1 and 3",
      "explanation": "Ozone is mainly found in two regions of the Earth's atmosphere. Most ozone (about 90%) resides in a layer that begins between 6 and 10 miles (10 and 17 kilometers) above the Earth's surface and extends up to about 30 miles (50 kilometers). This region of the atmosphere is called the stratosphere. The ozone in this region is commonly known as the ozone layer. The remaining ozone is in the lower region of the atmosphere, which is commonly called the troposphere. This layer serves as a shield from the ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun."

      ],
      "answer": "A species confined to a particular region and not found anywhere else",
      "explanation": "An endemic species, however, is a native species found only in a particular area, large or small. Often, endemic species are confined to a certain area because they are highly adapted to a particular niche. The term could refer to an animal, a plant, a fungus, or even a microorganism. Some of the endemic species in India are Grey-headed Bulbul, Malabar Lark, Nilgiri Flycatcher and Grey Jungle fowl etc."
