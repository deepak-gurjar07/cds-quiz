      "answer": "1 and only",
      "explanation": "Large scale exploitation of ground water is done with the help of tube wells. Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan receive less than 40 cm annual rainfall and are deficient in surface water resources. As such, these states exploit more than 85 per cent of the available ground water for irrigation. The demand for ground water for irrigation started increasing in Punjab and Haryana with the advent of Green Revolution in 1960s. States/union territories with small replenishable ground water resource of less than one BCM/year are Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Delhi, Lakshadweep and Pondicherry."

      "explanation": "Jhum is a traditional form of shifting cultivation common in the North-East. Slash-and-burn is a mere land clearing method used by many people around the globe to open up forest land and use it for permanent agriculture. On the contrary, shifting cultivation is an integrated farming system involving forestry, agriculture and strong social organisation on the part of the communities. The village or group of villages practice jhum on one particular tract of land until the soil is depleted of nutrients and then move on to another allowing the former tract of land to regenerate."

Tectonic plates are able to move because the Earth's lithosphere has greater strength than the underlying asthenosphere. The outer shell of the earth, the lithosphere is broken up into tectonic plates.
