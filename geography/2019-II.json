      "answer": "Soil getting very deficient in plant nutrients",
      "explanation": "Soil impoverishment is based on the innate ability of prairie plants to tolerate and flourish in soils with low levels of nitrogen. Soil impoverishment, or reverse fertilization, involves the removal of nutrients from the soil.It is most of- ten done by introducing large amounts of organic matter to the soil."

      "answer": "A-3, B-4, C-1, D-2",
      "explanation": "Oxisols- (from French oxide, “oxide”) are very highly weathered soils that are found primarily in the intertropical regions of the world. These soils contain few weatherable minerals and are often rich in Fe and Al oxide minerals.<br>Vertisols -a clayey soil with little organic matter which occurs in regions having distinct wet and dry seasons. The dominant soil-forming processes in Vertisols are: cracking, argilli-pedoturbation (mixing of clay in the pedon) and mass movement of materials due to shrinkage and swelling of clays during drying/wetting cycles. ... The wetting and drying cycles cause the clays to expand and contract.<br>Histosols- (from Greek histos, “tissue”) are soils that are composed mainly of organic materials. They contain at least 20-30 percent organic matter by weight and are more than 40 cm thick. Bulk densities are quite low, often less than 0.3 g cm3.<br>Entisols- are defined as soils that do not show any profile development other than an A horizon. An entisol has no diagnostic horizons, and most are basically unaltered from their parent material, which can be unconsolidated sediment or rock."

      "explanation": "Temperate coniferous forest is a terrestrial habitat type defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature. Temperate coniferous forests are found predominantly in areas with warm summers and cool winters and vary in their kinds of plant life. In some, needle leaf trees dominate, while others are home primarily to broadleaf evergreen trees or a mix of both tree types.[1] A separate habitat type, the tropical coniferous forests, occurs in more tropical climates. Temperate coniferous forests are common in the coastal areas of regions that have mild winters and heavy rainfall, or inland in drier climates Temperate coniferous forests sustain the highest levels of biomass in any terrestrial ecosystem and are notable for trees of massive proportions in temperate rainforest regions."
