      "non-zero but not a constant",

    ],
    "answer": "non-zero but not a constant",
    "explanation": "Circular motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path. It can be uniform with constant angular rate of rotation and constant speed or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation. Since, the object’s velocity vector is constantly changing direction, the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a centripetal force in the direction of the centre of rotation without this acceleration, the object would move in a straight line, according to Newton’s laws of motion. Hence, the acceleration of the car is a non-zero but not a constant."

    "answer": "0.85 km",
    "explanation": "Given, speed of sound = 340 m/s Let the distance of the mountain from the source of sound is d. To heard echo after 5 s, sound will travel 2d distance. Since Echo is repection of sound which is reflected from any surface. ∴ Speed = Distance Time ⇒ 340 2 5 = d ⇒ d = × =170 5 850 m = 0"

    "explanation": "If the speed of a moving magnet inside a coil increases, the electric current in the coil increases. Whenever, a magnetic field and an electric conductor move relative to one another, so the conductor crosses lines of force in the magnetic field. Hence, the current produced by electromagnetic induction is greater."
