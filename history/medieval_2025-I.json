      "question": "Consider the following statements about the use of stirrup in India:\n1. The Konarak horse sculpture (c. 1250) shows a ring-stirrup.\n2. A broad, probably wooden, stirrup appears in Khajuraho sculptures (probably 10th century).\n3. The iron-stirrup was used in the Delhi Sultanâ€™s armies from the thirteen century onwards.\nHow many of the above statements is/are correct?",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "(a) 1",
        "(c) 3",
        "(b) 2",
        "(d) Nil"
      ],
      "answer": "(c) 3",
      "explanation": "All three statements are correct. Konark horse sculpture (c. 1250) does indeed show a ring-stirrup, which is a notable feature of early stirrup design. Khajuraho sculptures (10th century) depict a wooden stirrup, reflecting the early use of stirrups in India. Iron stirrups were introduced and used by Delhi Sultanate armies from the 13th century onwards, marking a significant advancement in cavalry warfare. Thus, all three statements are correct."

      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "(a) use of fertiliser enhancing the quality of indigo crop.",
        "(b) introduction of mechanical crushing tools for indigo stems.",
        "(c) use of gypsum and lime mortars in making the inner surfaces of indigo vats waterproof.",
        "(d) employment of slave labour in quick distilling of indigo curcibles."
      ],
      "answer": "(c) use of gypsum and lime mortars in making the inner surfaces of indigo vats waterproof.",
"explanation": "In medieval India, a great improvement in the process of indigo extraction occurred with the use of gypsum and lime mortars to make the inner surfaces of indigo vats waterproof. This development ensured better retention of water and chemicals in the vats, which enhanced the efficiency and quality of the indigo dyeing process. The other options, such as the use of mechanical crushing tools or fertilisers, did not have the same significant impact on the indigo extraction process as the waterproofing of vats."
