        "Nil"
      ],
      "answer": "3",
      "explanation": "All three statements are correct. Konark horse sculpture (c. 1250) does indeed show a ring-stirrup, which is a notable feature of early stirrup design. Khajuraho sculptures (10th century) depict a wooden stirrup, reflecting the early use of stirrups in India. Iron stirrups were introduced and used by Delhi Sultanate armies from the 13th century onwards, marking a significant advancement in cavalry warfare. Thus, all three statements are correct."

      ],
      "answer": "use of gypsum and lime mortars in making the inner surfaces of indigo vats waterproof.",
"explanation": "In medieval India, a great improvement in the process of indigo extraction occurred with the use of gypsum and lime mortars to make the inner surfaces of indigo vats waterproof. This development ensured better retention of water and chemicals in the vats, which enhanced the efficiency and quality of the indigo dyeing process. The other options, such as the use of mechanical crushing tools or fertilisers, did not have the same significant impact on the indigo extraction process as the waterproofing of vats."
