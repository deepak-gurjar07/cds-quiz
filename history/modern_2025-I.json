      ],
      "answer": "3",
      "explanation": "All three statements are correct regarding European arms used in warfare in India. Flint-lock muskets were a significant advancement over earlier matchlocks and could function relatively well in wet weather, unlike matchlocks that relied on a burning wick. The addition of bayonets made muskets highly effective in close combat, serving as both a firearm and a spear. Wrought-iron cannon barrels were lighter and more manoeuvrable than earlier bronze ones, improving battlefield mobility. Hence, all three statements are correct."
