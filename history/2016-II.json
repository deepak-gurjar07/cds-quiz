      "answer": "Statement I is true but Statement II is false",
      "explanation": "Zamindars during the Mughal era were petty landholders in the villages, descendants of old ruling families who retained small portions of their ancestral lands. They generally made collection from the individual peasants at rates fixed by custom or by themselves and paid a fixed tax to the Government. The difference between his collections and the amount he paid to the state was his personal income. Thus Zamindars became exploitative. Due to this exploitative nature they did not receive any support of the peasantry in a large number of agrarian uprisings in North India in the seventeenth century."
