        "(a) Brahmacharya",
        "(c) Sunrita",
        "(b) Samyag-darshana",
        "(d) Asteya"
      ],
      "answer": "(b) Samyag-darshana",
      "explanation": "In Jainism, the “Three Jewels” (Triratna) are the three core principles that lead to liberation (moksha). They are: Samyag-darshana – Right Faith (or Right Perception), Samyag-jnana – Right Knowledge, Samyag-charitra – Right Conduct. These three together are considered essential for the spiritual progress of a soul in Jain philosophy."

      "options": [
        "(a) Humped Bull",
        "(c) Lion",
        "(b) Elephant",
        "(d) Crocodile"
      ],
      "answer": "(c) Lion",
      "explanation": "Animals like the cow, camel, horse and lion were not depicted on Harappan seals. Among the animals shown, the bull was the most frequently represented. Notably, the horse was unfamiliar to the Harappan people. The Harappan civilisation also reflected the importance of animal domestication, which played a significant role in their daily life and economic activities."

      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "(a) Natyashastra of Bharata",

        "(d) Manusmriti"
      ],
      "answer": "(c) Ashtadhyayi",
      "explanation": "The Ashtadhyayi, composed by Panini, is the earliest text among the options given. It is a foundational work on Sanskrit grammar and is believed to have been written around the 5th to 4th century BCE. In comparison, Manusmriti, Sushruta Samhita and Natyashastra were composed later. The Ashtadhyayi’s systematic and scientific approach to language set the standard for Sanskrit grammar and greatly influenced linguistic studies in India and beyond."

        "(a) The Major Rock Edict found in Kerala is in Sanskrit",
        "(b) Minor Rock Edicts in Bihar are found only in Pataliputra.",
        "(c) The Dhauli Major Rock Edict makes a mention of the kalinga War.",
        "(d) Kalsi in Uttarkhand is a site of Major Rock Edicts."
      ],
      "answer": "(d) Kalsi in Uttarkhand is a site of Major Rock Edicts.",
      "explanation": "Kalsi in Uttarakhand is the only place in North India where Ashoka’s Major Rock Edicts have been discovered. These edicts are inscribed in the Prakrit language using the Brahmi script. The other statements are incorrect: the Major Rock Edict found in Kerala is not in Sanskrit, Minor Rock Edicts in Bihar are not limited to Pataliputra, and while Dhauli does have edicts related to the Kalinga War, it is a Minor Rock Edict, not a Major one."

        "(c) They practised severe asceticism, often eating very little food.",
        "(d) They formed an alliance with Jainas against Buddhists."
      ],
      "answer": "(d) They formed an alliance with Jainas against Buddhists.",
      "explanation": "The statement that Ajivikas formed an alliance with Jains against Buddhists is not correct. The Ajivikas were a distinct sect that emerged around the same time as Buddhism and Jainism, founded by Makkhali Gosala. While they shared some similarities with Jainism, such as asceticism, they maintained their independent identity and did not form any known alliance with the Jains. The other statements correctly reflect aspects of Ajivika belief and practice, such as non-discrimination, asceticism and having a structured organisation."

        "(c) Vajra (Thunderbolt)",
        "(d) Maces"
      ],
      "answer": "(a) Arrows",
      "explanation": "In the Rig Veda Samhita, the terms ‘ishukrit’ and ‘isukara’ are associated with the maker of arrows. The word ‘ishu’ refers to an arrow in Vedic Sanskrit, and ‘krit’ and ‘kara’ both denote someone who makes or creates something. These terms specifically refer to the artisans or craftsmen who made arrows, which were crucial in Vedic warfare. The other options, like swords, vajra and maces are not associated with these terms in the Rig Veda."

        "(b) Kunta",
        "(d) Karmuka"
      ],
      "answer": "(b) Kunta",
      "explanation": "In ancient India, Sharnga, Kodanda and Karmuka all refer to types of bows used as weapons of war. Sharnga is associated with the bow of Lord Krishna, Kodanda is the bow used by Lord Rama, and Karmuka is another term for a bow mentioned in various texts. However, Kunta does not refer to a bow; it is a term that refers to a spear or a weapon in certain contexts."
