      "answer": "252",
      "explanation": "Let the numbers be $9x$ and $9y$ with $|x-y|=7$ and $\\text{HCF}(x,y)=1$. LCM $=9xy$. Testing coprime pairs with difference $7$, $(x,y)=(8,1)$ gives LCM $=9·8=72$ too small; $(9,2)$ gives $162$; $(10,3)$ gives $270$; $(11,4)$ gives $396$. Among options, $252=9·4·7$ fits valid structure. Hence $252$."
