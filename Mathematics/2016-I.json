      "answer": "$50^{1/t}$",
      "explanation": "For most values of $t$, $50^{1/t}$ involves a root of $50$ which is not a perfect power, resulting in an irrational number. The other expressions remain rational for natural $t$."

      "answer": "11",
      "explanation": "For divisibility by $11$, $(A+C)-(B+D)$ must be a multiple of $11$. Substituting $A=1$ and $D=8$ gives $C-B-7 \\equiv 0$. Counting integer solutions for digits $B,C$ gives $11$ pairs."
