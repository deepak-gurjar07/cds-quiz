      "explanation": "Compute differences: $598-458=140$, $672-598=74$, $672-458=214$. The HCF of $140,74,$ and $214$ is $28$. Hence the required greatest number is $28$."

Checking higher multiples, $144-7=137$ fails, $216-7=209$ too large. Direct checking shows $191$ satisfies all remainder conditions."
