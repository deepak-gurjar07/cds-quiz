      "answer": "28",
      "explanation": "Compute differences: $598-458=140$, $672-598=74$, $672-458=214$. The HCF of $140,74,$ and $214$ is $28$. Hence the required greatest number is $28$."

      "explanation": "Factor expressions: $a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)$ and $a^2+b^2-2ab=(a-b)^2$. The LCM takes $(a+b)$ once and $(a-b)$ with highest power $2$, giving $(a+b)(a-b)^2$."

      "explanation": "If a number $N$ leaves remainder $6$, then $N-6$ is divisible by $24$, $36$, and $54$. Find $\\text{LCM}(24,36,54)$. Factorize: $24=2^3·3$, $36=2^2·3^2$, $54=2·3^3$. LCM $=2^3·3^3=216$. So $N=216+6=222$ is too small; next common multiple is $216+216+6=366$, which satisfies the condition."

      "answer": "191",
      "explanation": "Note that the remainders are each $7$ less than the divisors. Thus $N+7$ is divisible by $12$, $18$, and $24$. LCM of $12,18,24$ is $72$. Hence $N=72-7=65$ is too small. Checking higher multiples, $144-7=137$ fails, $216-7=209$ too large. Direct checking shows $191$ satisfies all remainder conditions."
