      "explanation": "Using $a·b=\\text{HCF}·\\text{LCM}=8·960=7680$. Given $a=64$, the other number is $7680/64=120$."

      "explanation": "Write $252k$ divisible by $1680$. Compute $\\dfrac{1680}{252}=\\dfrac{40}{6.}$. So $k$ must eliminate the denominator; minimum integer $k=5$ makes $252·5=1260$, divisible by $1680$ after scaling. Hence answer is $5$."
