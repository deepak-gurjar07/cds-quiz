        "I only",
        "II only",
        "Both",
        "Neither"
      ],
      "answer": "I only",
      "explanation": "Composite numbers are positive integers, hence natural. However, $0$ is a whole number but not a natural number, so statement II is false."

      "question": "A number gives remainder $28$ when divided by $143$. What is the remainder when the same number is divided by $13$?",

        "0",
        "2",
        "9",
        "10"
      ],
      "answer": "2",
      "explanation": "Since $143=11\times13$, the remainder when divided by $13$ is simply $28\bmod13=2$."

      "answer": "14",
      "explanation": "List multiples of $2$: $-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,0,2,4,6,8,10$. Multiples of $3$: $-9,-6,-3,0,3,6,9$. Combining and removing repeats gives $14$ distinct numbers."

      "answer": "2",
      "explanation": "A number divisible by $33$ must be divisible by both $3$ and $11$. The digit sum of $231228$ is $18$, already divisible by $3$. Checking divisibility by $11$ using alternating sums fails; adding $2$ satisfies both conditions."

      ],
      "answer": "Infinite",
      "explanation": "Between any two real numbers, infinitely many rational numbers exist. Since $1$ and $1000$ are real numbers, there are infinitely many rationals between them."

      "answer": "(65,91)",
      "explanation": "Check highest common factor (HCF). $65=5\times13$ and $91=7\times13$ share only one common factor? No, correction: they share none other than $1$. Hence they are relatively prime."

      "explanation": "The last two digits are $74$ (not divisible by $4$). Last three digits are $974$ (not divisible by $8$). Alternating digit sum test fails for $11$. Hence none apply."
