      "answer": "I only",
      "explanation": "Composite numbers are positive integers, hence natural. However, $0$ is a whole number but not a natural number, so statement II is false."

        "9",

      "answer": "2",
      "explanation": "Since $143=11\times13$, the remainder when divided by $13$ is simply $28\bmod13=2$."

      "answer": "2",
      "explanation": "A number divisible by $33$ must be divisible by both $3$ and $11$. The digit sum of $231228$ is $18$, already divisible by $3$. Checking divisibility by $11$ using alternating sums fails; adding $2$ satisfies both conditions."
