      "answer": "$(x+2)^2(x-2)(x-6)$",
      "explanation": "Note that $x^2 - 4x - 12 = x^2 - 6x + 2x - 12 = x(x-6)+2(x-6) = (x+2)(x-6)$. The first expression is $(x+2)^2(x-2)$. For the LCM take each factor with its highest power: $(x+2)^2$, $(x-2)$, $(x-6)$. So LCM is $(x+2)^2(x-2)(x-6)$."

      "answer": "17",
      "explanation": "Each variety is arranged separately in equal rows. The number of trees per row must divide 21, 42 and 56, so we use $\\text{HCF}(21,42,56)=7$ trees per row (to minimize the number of rows). Mango rows $=21/7=3$, apple rows $=42/7=6$, orange rows $=56/7=8$. Total rows $=3+6+8=17$."
