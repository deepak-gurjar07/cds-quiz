      "answer": "17",
      "explanation": "Trial multiplication shows that $845 \times 5 = 4225$, matching the pattern $X215$ with $X=8$, $Y=4$, $Z=5$. Thus $X+Y+Z = 8+4+5 = 17$."

      "answer": "10",
      "explanation": "Divisibility by $9$ requires the digit sum $7+6+3+X+4+Y+2 = 22+X+Y$ to be a multiple of $9$. Counting digit pairs $(X,Y)$ between $0$ and $9$ satisfying this gives $10$."
