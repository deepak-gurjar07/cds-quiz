      "answer": "55",
      "explanation": "HCF must be a divisor of every number, and hence a divisor of the LCM. So any possible HCF must divide $150$. The divisors of $150$ include $15,25,50$ but not $55$ (since $150/55$ is not an integer). Therefore $55$ cannot be the HCF."

      "explanation": "Factor the expressions by grouping. First: $x^2 + bx - x - b = x(x+b) - 1(x+b) = (x-1)(x+b)$. Second: $x^2 + x(a-1) - a = x^2 + ax - x - a = x(x+a) - 1(x+a) = (x-1)(x+a)$. The common factor is $(x-1)$, so the HCF is $x-1$."
