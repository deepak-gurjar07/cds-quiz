      "answer": "55",
      "explanation": "HCF must be a divisor of every number, and hence a divisor of the LCM. So any possible HCF must divide $150$. The divisors of $150$ include $15,25,50$ but not $55$ (since $150/55$ is not an integer). Therefore $55$ cannot be the HCF."

      "answer": "$x-1$",
      "explanation": "Factor the expressions by grouping. First: $x^2 + bx - x - b = x(x+b) - 1(x+b) = (x-1)(x+b)$. Second: $x^2 + x(a-1) - a = x^2 + ax - x - a = x(x+a) - 1(x+a) = (x-1)(x+a)$. The common factor is $(x-1)$, so the HCF is $x-1$."

      "explanation": "Factor each expression. First: $6x^3+60x^2+150x = 6x(x^2+10x+25) = 6x(x+5)^2$. Second: $3x^4+12x^3-15x^2 = 3x^2(x^2+4x-5) = 3x^2(x+5)(x-1)$. For the LCM we take each distinct factor with its highest power across both: numeric factor $6$, $x^2$, $(x+5)^2$, $(x-1)$, giving $6x^2(x+5)^2(x-1)$."
