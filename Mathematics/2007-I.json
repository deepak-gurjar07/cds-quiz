      "answer": "x = 1, y = -1",
      "explanation": "For divisibility by $11$, take the difference between the sum of digits at odd places and even places: $(1+5+9+4)-(2+4+3)=10$. To make the number divisible by $11$, this difference must be $0$ or a multiple of $11$, so we add $1$. Hence $x=1$. For divisibility by $3$, the sum of digits is $1+2+5+4+9+3+4 = 28$. To make $28+y$ divisible by $3$, we must add $y=-1$. Therefore, $x=1$ and $y=-1$."

      "answer": "0,2,4,6 or 8",
      "explanation": "A number divisible by $5$ must end in $0$ or $5$. For divisibility by $4$, the last two digits must be divisible by $4$. If the unit digit is $0$, the tens digit can be $0,2,4,6,$ or $8$ to make a multiple of $4$. Hence these are the possible digits at the tens place."

      "explanation": "First find the sum of digits: $2+6+4+9+2+5+1+8=37$. To make the result divisible by $3$, the digit sum must be a multiple of $3$. $37-4=33$, which is divisible by $3$ but also divisible by $9$ — however the number itself is not divisible by $9$ because the subtraction changes only the digit sum condition.
