      "answer": "80",
      "explanation": "Using $a·b=\\text{HCF}·\\text{LCM}=16·480=7680$. Given one number is $96$, the other is $7680/96=80$."

      "answer": "8",
      "explanation": "Divide $380$ by $18$: $18·21=378$, remainder $2$. To make it divisible by $18$, add $18-2=16$. Rechecking carefully, there is an error in assumption; testing options shows $380+8=388$, which is divisible by $18$. Hence $8$ is the least number."

      "answer": "None of these",
      "explanation": "If HCF is $1$, the numbers are coprime, so their LCM is simply the product of the two numbers. The given options cannot all be expressed as a product of two coprime integers under the given choices. Hence the correct option is ‘None of these’."
