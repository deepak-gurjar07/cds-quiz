      "answer": "Both",
      "explanation": "For Statement I: A well-known result in number theory states that numbers of the form $4k+3$ cannot be written as sums of two squares. For Statement II: Let an odd integer be $2m+1$. Then $(2m+1)^2 = 4m(m+1)+1$. Since one of $m, m+1$ is even, $4m(m+1)$ is divisible by $8$, so the square is of the form $8k+1$. Hence both statements are true."

      "answer": "24",
      "explanation": "Rewrite $n^2(n^2-1)=n^2(n-1)(n+1)$. The three consecutive integers $(n-1),n,(n+1)$ ensure divisibility by $6$, and the extra factor of $n$ provides additional evenness. Hence the product is always divisible by $24$."
