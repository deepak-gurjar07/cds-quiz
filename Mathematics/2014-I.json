      "explanation": "For Statement I: A well-known result in number theory states that numbers of the form $4k+3$ cannot be written as sums of two squares. For Statement II: Let an odd integer be $2m+1$. Then $(2m+1)^2 = 4m(m+1)+1$. Since one of $m, m+1$ is even, $4m(m+1)$ is divisible by $8$, so the square is of the form $8k+1$. Hence both statements are true."
