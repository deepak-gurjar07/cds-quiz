      "answer": "6",
      "explanation": "Write $a=7m+5$ and $b=7n+4$. Then $ab=(7m+5)(7n+4) = 49mn + 7(4m+5n) + 20$. The term $20$ gives the remainder when divided by $7$, so the remainder is $20\bmod7=6$."

      "answer": "451",
      "explanation": "Let the number be $100a+10b+1$. Its reverse is $100+10b+a$. Given $100a+10b+1 = 100+10b+a+297$. Solving gives $a=4$, $b=5$. Hence the number is $451$."

      "answer": "0",
      "explanation": "$21^{2n}=(441)^n$, which always ends in $1$. $64^n=(8^2)^n$ always ends in $6$. The difference $1-6$ gives a last digit of $0$ (borrowed subtraction). Hence the last digit is $0$."
