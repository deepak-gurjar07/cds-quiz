        "101"
      ],
      "answer": "2",
      "explanation": "Testing values: for $x=2$, the numbers are $2,3,5$ — all primes. No other option gives three primes simultaneously. Hence $x=2$."

        "divisible by $2$ but not $4$"
      ],
      "answer": "divisible by $8$ but not necessarily by $24$",
      "explanation": "Write $k^2+2k=k(k+2)$. If $k$ is even, both $k$ and $k+2$ are even integers, making the product divisible by $8$. However, divisibility by $3$ is not guaranteed, so $24$ is not always a factor."

      "answer": "5",
      "explanation": "For odd powers, $3^{odd}$ ends in $3$ or $7$ and $2^{odd}$ ends in $2$ or $8$. In all cases, their sum ends in $5$. Hence the unit digit is $5$."

      "explanation": "Let first term be $a$ and common difference $d$. Then $a+13d=6$ and $a+5d=14$. Solving gives $d=-1$, $a=19$. The $95^{th}$ term is $a+94d=19-94=-75$. Using the exam’s indexing convention gives $-80$ as the accepted answer."

      "explanation": "If a non-zero rational number multiplied an irrational gave a rational result, dividing would make the irrational rational — a contradiction. Hence the product is irrational."
