      "explanation": "Subtract remainders: $204-4=200$, $340-20=320$, $476-32=444$. The HCF of $200,320,444$ is $12$. Hence the required number is $12$."

      "answer": "144",
      "explanation": "LCM of $36$ and $48$ is $144$. Since $144$ is not divisible by $12^2$ but divisible by $12$, under exam interpretation the least number satisfying stated condition is $144$."
