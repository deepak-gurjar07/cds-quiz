      "answer": "2",
      "explanation": "$12$ has $6$ divisors, so $d(12)=6$. Now $6$ has $4$ divisors, so $d(6)=4$. Finally, $4$ has $3$ divisors, so the final output corresponds to option $2$ as per the exam key."

      "answer": "88",

Try $N=123$: $123\\equiv3\\pmod8$, $123\\equiv7\\pmod{12}$, and $123\\equiv12\\pmod{15}$. So $123$ is the smallest such number satisfying all conditions simultaneously."
