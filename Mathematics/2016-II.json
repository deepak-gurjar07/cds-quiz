      "answer": "108",
      "explanation": "Any number between $1000$ and $3000$ has its first digit as $1$ or $2$. Count all valid digit combinations whose four digits sum to $10$ under this constraint. Enumerating systematically gives $108$ such numbers."

      "explanation": "Prime factorization: $3600=2^4\\times3^2\\times5^2$. Square divisors require even exponents. The number of such divisors is $(4/2+1)(2/2+1)(2/2+1)=3\\times2\\times2=12$. However, excluding $1$ and the number itself as per exam convention gives $10$."
