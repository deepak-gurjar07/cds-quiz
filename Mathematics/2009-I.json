      "answer": "47",
      "explanation": "If a number $d$ leaves the same remainder on dividing all three numbers, then $d$ must divide the pairwise differences: $486-392=94$, $627-486=141$, $627-392=235$. So $d$ is a common divisor of $94,141,235$. The HCF of these three is $47$, and this is the greatest such number."

      "answer": "$(x+y+z)(x-y-z)(x-y+z)$",
      "explanation": "Rewrite each expression using identities. Note that $x^2 - y^2 - z^2 - 2yz = x^2 - (y+z)^2 = (x+y+z)(x-y-z)$. Similarly, $x^2 - y^2 + z^2 + 2xz = (x+z)^2 - y^2 = (x+z+y)(x+z-y) = (x+y+z)(x+z-y)$, and $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - 2xy = (x-y)^2 - z^2 = (x-y+z)(x-y-z)$. The LCM must contain each distinct linear factor that appears: $(x+y+z)$, $(x-y-z)$, $(x-y+z)$. So the LCM is $(x+y+z)(x-y-z)(x-y+z)$."
