      "explanation": "Test small natural values of $n$. For $n=2$, the numbers are $2$, $5$, and $11$, which are all prime. For $n≥3$, at least one of the expressions becomes composite. Hence only one value of $n$ is possible."

      "explanation": "Write $72=2^3·3^2$. Count unordered triples $(a,b,c)$ such that $abc=72$. Enumerating all possible combinations of three positive factors (without regard to order) gives $15$ distinct factorizations."
