      "explanation": "LCM of $8$ and $12$ is $24$, but $24$ is divisible by $6$. The next multiple is $48$, which is divisible by $8$ and $12$ but not by $6$. Hence the answer is $48$."

      "explanation": "Let number of boys be $x$, girls $=85-x$. Given $85-x=0.7x$, so $x=50$ and girls $=35$. Boys playing badminton $=60\\%$ of 50 = 30. Boys playing only badminton $=25$. Children playing only table tennis $=40\\%$ of 85 = 34. Boys playing only table tennis $=50-30=20$. Girls playing only table tennis $=34-20=14$. Girls playing both = $12-5=7$.
